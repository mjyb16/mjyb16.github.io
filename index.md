## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="IMG_6859.png">

I am currently a PhD student in astrophysics at the Ciela Institute of the University of Montreal and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/misha-barth). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, during which time I was fortunate to participate in an NSF REU at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.

My research focuses on the dark side of the universe: supermassive black holes, gravitational lensing, dark matter, and other mysterious forces. You can read more about my work under the [Research](https://darthbarth.science/research) tab. 

I spend most of my working hours writing computer code. A list of the software projects I have been involved in can be found under the [Software](https://darthbarth.science/software) tab. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and playing musical instruments (cello, mandola, and guitar).
