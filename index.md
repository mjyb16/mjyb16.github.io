## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="IMG_6859.png">

<p>I am currently a PhD student in astrophysics at the <a href="https://ciela.science/team/michael-j-barth/">Ciela Institute</a> of the University of Montreal and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/directory/misha-barth">Mila</a>. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, during which time I was fortunate to participate in an NSF REU at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the dark side of the universe: supermassive black holes, gravitational lensing, dark matter, and other aspects of the cosmos which are governed by mysterious forces. I am primarily an observational astronomer: my preferred method of intergalactic travel is by radio interferometer (pictured above: ALMA). You can read more about my work under the <a href="https://darthbarth.science/research">Research</a> tab.</p>

<p>I spend most of my working hours writing computer code. A list of the software projects I have been involved in can be found under the <a href="https://darthbarth.science/software">Software</a> tab. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, skiing, and playing musical instruments (cello, mandola, and guitar). In a past life, I was also a student of the humanities (Russian, to be exact), which is how I learned to make websites like this one and also <a href="http://soviet-rock.obdurodon.org/">this one</a>.</p>
