## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="IMG_6859.png">

I am currently a PhD student in astrophysics at the Ciela Institute of the University of Montreal. Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, during which time I was fortunate to participate in an NSF REU at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.

## Software Packages and Tools

Here is a quick table of various open-source software packages whose development I am leading (^) or have been heavily involved in as a developer. Projects whose code I am presently involved in actively maintaining are in bold. I primarily work with the Python programming language. 

Software name | Collaboration | Description
--------------|-------------------|--------
[**Caustics**](https://caustics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#) | Ciela Institute | Gravitational lensing modeling (GPU-accelerated)
[Iris](https://github.com/EnceladeCandy/IRIS) | Ciela Institute | Interferometric imaging using diffusion model-based Bayesian priors
