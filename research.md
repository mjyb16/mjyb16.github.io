## Research Interests
Our understanding of the dark side of the universe, from black holes to dark matter and dark energy, has historically been limited by the dark sector's electromagnetic invisibility and the maze of complex physics interactions that occur between the visible and invisible parts of the universe. From a broad perspective, my research goals are to develop new modeling methodologies to bridge this gap between the complexity of the universe as captured in telescope data and the practical need for interpretable, testable mathematical models for what we observe. 

My current research focus is centered on galactic dynamics in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. I am developing new techniques for high-resolution dynamical mass modeling which can be applied both to local galaxies and to highly-magnified gravitationally lensed galaxies in the early universe.

As a multiwavelength astronomer, I have worked with both optical and radio wave data. However, these days I primarily work with radio interferometers such as ALMA due to their exquisite spatial resolution. As a result, a large part of my research is focused on UV-plane modeling and interferometric imaging techniques. 

The recent Cambrian explosion of neural networks has opened up a variety of new data-driven modeling approaches which can be applied to astronomy. Furthermore, the rise of GPUs in scientific computing applications has opened new horizons of complexity and data volume. In light of this, my research is closely connected to advances in machine learning and supercomputing.
