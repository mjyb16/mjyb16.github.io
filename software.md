## Quick links: Key Software Packages and Tools

Here is a quick table of various software packages whose development I have lead (^), have been heavily involved in as a developer, or have incorporated into one of my other projects in a major way. Projects whose code I am presently involved in actively maintaining are marked with an asterisk under the collaboration column.

Software name | Collaboration | Description
--------------|-------------------|--------
[Caskade](https://caskade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#) | [Ciela Institute](https://ciela.science/) | Framework for building object-oriented scientific simulators
[Caustics](https://caustics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#) | [Ciela Institute*](https://ciela.science/) | Gravitational lensing simulator (GPU-accelerated)
^[CluMPR](https://github.com/mjyb16/CluMPR_DESI) | University of Pittsburgh | Galaxy cluster-finder algorithm optimized for photometric optical surveys
[Iris](https://github.com/EnceladeCandy/IRIS) | [Ciela Institute](https://ciela.science/) | Interferometric imaging using diffusion model-based Bayesian priors
^[SiRIUS](https://sirius-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) | [NRAO CASA NGI](https://github.com/casangi) | Simulator for radio interferometry (full-stokes Radio Interferometry Measurement Equation)
^SuperMAGE | GLAMOR* | Coming soon....
